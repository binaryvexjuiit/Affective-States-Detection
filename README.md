# Affective-States-Classification
 
A neural network based on CNN-LSTM to predict the facial expression
from MMA dataset which can classify 7 affective states such as angry, disgust, fear, happy,
neutral, sad, and surprise. Features from the pictures automatically extracted in Convolutional
Neural Network layer, ensued by a Long Short Term Memory neural network architecture
to classify the facial expression from the input. This model works best because of CNN, it 
helps to fetch the most important features from the image. In MMA facial expression dataset,
there are 3 directories - train, test, and validation, validation directory used for observing which
model works better for a given dataset. Each of the directory has 7 sub-directories which
consist of 7 distinguished facial expressions. In Train set, there are total 17366 images,
whereas Test set encompasses approx. 92926 images, while validation set has 17356 instances.
